			<h1>Japan 2018 Wrap Up</h1>
			<div class="description">Kata spends 5 weeks in Japan</div>

			<p>
        In the spring of 2018, I went to Japan for five weeks. This was my first
        time visiting Japan and Asia in general. I spent the first three weeks of
        the trip traveling by myself in Miyazaki Prefecture. Traveling is a
        generous name for what I did during those weeks, as I barely left the
        surftown I was visiting, Aoshima. After these weeks spent alone, I met
        up with a friend from highschool, and we traveled to Tokyo, Kyoto, Nara,
        and Osaka together.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I returned to the U.S., I shared stories and snacks with my mom,
        who was eager to hear about my trip. Only taking photos on my iPhone, I
        struggled to find a good way to communicate my experience with her.
        So... this is for you, mom!
      </p>
			<p>
				My first couple of hours in Japan were pretty shocking. I took the
				Narita Express into Tokyo, where I would stay for my first night before
				leaving for Aoshima. Exiting Tokyo Station for the first time was
				surreal, so much so that I felt I had to take a photo to capture the
				moment.

			<p>
				I spent the night wandering around Akasaka, stopping in everyone of the
				big three convenience store chains: 7-Eleven, Lawson's, and Family Mart.
				The following morning, fueled by jetlag, I got up around 5:00am and
				walked over to Roppongi Hills where nothing was open and the Tokyo
				morning haze was on display.
			</p>
			<p>
				I made my way over to Haneda to catch my flight to Miyazaki. It was here
				where I first came to understand the excellence of Japanese travel hubs.
				The terminals themselves are not too remarkable, with minimal gates and
				short security lines. However, before entering security, travelers and
				their loved ones can enjoy an entire MALL of cafes, bookstores, omiage
				shops, and full-blown restaurants. At Narita and the Miyazaki airports,
				I also found observation decks where you can watch the planes take off.
				This time leaving from Haneda, I had my first real Japanese restaurant
				experience. I got a bento ebi tendon and zaru soba from a restaurant
				that advertised this meal with plastic replicas in its window.
			</p>
			<p>
				With some difficulty, I took a taxi from the Miyazaki airport to the
				Aoshima guest house where I would be staying for the next three weeks. I
				was immediately struck by the floral, jasmine-like smell in the air and
				the picturesque sight of the beach. I was greeted by the owner of the
				guesthouse, and was taken to meet the manager (German) and two other
				guesthouse staff (Mexican and Canadian).
			</p>
			<p>
				Aoshima and Miyazaki City in particular were really interesting to
				experience. I think that they don't fit neatly into the relatively
				limited picture of Japan that most Americans have. The area has tropical
				plants, huge paved roads and highways, car dealerships, skateparks,
				chain restaurants, and lots of big Aeon shopping centers. On a
				particularly suburban-America-feeling day, I visited a skatepark in
				Miyazaki City with one of my housemates and his nineteen year old friend
				who lives in the City after stopping at a McDonald's.

				Our responsibilities at the guesthouse were pretty limited, cleaning and
				straightening up rooms for a few hours a day, sometimes less. The owner
				of the guesthouse took us on a weekly shopping trip - first to the
				organic vegetable stand and then to Trial, a Walmart-like superstore.
			</p>
			<p>
				We would often bike along the water to get to a beach or into the City.
				Every ride was serene and magical, despite the loud, rusty beach
				cruisers we rode.

				My Aoshima lifestyle was extremely chill and cost-effective. Free
				activities were abundant in such a naturally beautiful place during its
				most mild time of year. In addition to bike riding, I surfed, ran along
				the beach, read library books on my Kindle, walked back and forth to the
				nearest 7-Eleven to buy candy, and spent countless hours enjoying the
				generosity of the Aoshima locals. Most meals we cooked for ourselves at
				the guesthouse. Whenever we did go out, the food was always really
				stunningly good.

				Miyazaki City, I suggest that you head straight to
